#+title: Plan

- Some high level abstraction of the DadaHDU itself (including header and data
  blocks)
- Reading and writing from the blocks should be transparent and safe
  + How do we do this if you have no idea what kind of data lives in there
- Headers should be a dict, I think the keys are always strings
  + Maybe do some smart serde of the values
- How do we handle cleanup?
  + What is this library for?
  + If it's for packet capture, we probably want to manage the memory of the
    buffers we create. I.e. we should cleanup on destruction
- Logs should just use tracing, do PSRDada logs have log level information?
- If not, just use =info=
- How do we make all the things we use safe?
